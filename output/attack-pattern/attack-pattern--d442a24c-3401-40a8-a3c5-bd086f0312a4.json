Groups are usually created around a specific topic or locality, and allow users to post content to the group, and interact with other users\u2019 posted content. <br><br>For example, Meta\u2019s Social Media Platform Facebook allows users to create a \u201cFacebook group\u201d. This feature is not exclusive to Social Media Platforms; the Microblogging Platform X (prev. Twitter) allows users to create \u201cX Communities\u201d, groups based on particular topics which users can join and post to; the Software Delivery Platform Steam allows users to create Steam Community Groups.<br><br>Online Community Groups can be open or gated (for example, groups can require admin approval before users can join).",
