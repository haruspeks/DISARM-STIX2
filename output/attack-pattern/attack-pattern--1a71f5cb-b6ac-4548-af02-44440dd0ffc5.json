They can also conduct DDOS attacks and other offensive cyber operations, aiming to take down digital assets or gain access to proprietary information. An influence operation may use hacktivist personas to support their operational narratives and legitimise their operational activities.<br><br>Fabricated Hacktivists are sometimes referred to as \u201cFaketivists\u201d.",
