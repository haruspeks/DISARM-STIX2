Threat actors can fabricate journalists to give the appearance of legitimacy, justifying the actor\u2019s requests for interviews, etc (T0143.002: Fabricated Persona, T0097.102: Journalist Persona).<br><br>People who have legitimately developed a persona as a journalist (T0143.001: Authentic Persona, T0097.102: Journalist Persona) can use it for malicious purposes, or be exploited by threat actors. For example, someone could take money for using their position as a trusted journalist to provide legitimacy to a false narrative or be tricked into doing so without the journalist\u2019s knowledge.",
